# Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors, also known as bugs, in your code. It's an essential part of software development that helps you ensure your code works as expected and delivers the desired results. Debugging involves identifying issues, understanding their causes, and implementing solutions to fix them.


Imagine debugging as a game of "Cluedo" (or "Clue"). You have a mystery to solve, and you're trying to find out "Who did it, with What weapon, in Which room?" In software debugging, you try to find "What went wrong, Where it went wrong, and Why it went wrong."

During the debugging process, you'll use various tools, techniques, and strategies to track down and fix the issues in your code. Some common debugging techniques include using print statements, stepping through code with a debugger, analyzing logs, and reviewing code for logical errors.

Debugging is crucial for ensuring that your software functions as intended, delivering a high-quality, reliable product to your users.
